# Description

This is a Google Keep clone built with Angular to practice and improve my Angular skills. It follows the original app's design principles and includes many core features. Based on [aBrihoum](https://github.com/aBrihoum/google-keep-clone/blob/master/README.md) repository.

**Note:** Double-click the sidenav to toggle notes visibility.

## Built With

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/) (IndexedDB wrapper)
- [Bricks.js](https://github.com/callmecavs/bricks.js/) (masonry layout)
